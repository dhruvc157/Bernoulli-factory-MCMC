Code demonstrating Portkey Barker's 2-coin algorithm ([Vats et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07471 "arxiv link")), and its effectiveness over the standard 2 coin algorithm for Half-normal mixture of Weibulls as the target distribution can be found in `Code`.


-Under guidance and instruction of Prof. Dootika Vats, as part of their course MTH707A (Markov Chain Monte Carlo).
